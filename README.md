## Welcome

This repository is a collection of projects that I started as an assignment for my computer science classes that is still 
under development. Credit for a lot of the ideas in these projects goes to the CS 474 curriculum.
Each of the projects are distinct, but most use tools from linear algebra, calculus, and probability 
including:
    <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
    <li>Recurrent Neural Networks</li>
    <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
    <li>Q Learning</li>
    <li>Proximal Policy Optimization</li>
    <li>Transformers</li>
    <li>Generators</li>
    <li>Markov Chains</li>
    <li>Transfer Learning>/li>
    <li>Working with GPT-2</li>
    <li>Working with Stable Diffusion</li>

### <a href="https://acme.byu.edu/">Applied and Computational Math Emphasis</a>

Brigham Young Universityâ€™s Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME) program is a major designed for solving the 
problems of the 21st century. Mathematics provides the foundation of modern technology and science, it is the key to 
building successful algorithms in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and it provides the analytical power 
needed to process, evaluate, and take full advantage of the ever-growing flood of data and information in the world. 
ACME is a new educational model that teaches both the theory and the practical skills in mathematics, statistics, and 
computation needed to solve the problems of the modern world.

## Project Descriptions

### <a name="cancer">Cancer Detection</a>
This project uses a U-Net convolutional neural network structure to detect cancerous cells in images

### <a name="cartpole">Cartpole with RL and PPO</a>
This project uses a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train a reinforcement learning agent to balance a 
cartpole. The agent is trained using a custom environment that is based on the OpenAI Gym Cartpole environment. The 
environment is modified to allow for a more complex reward system and to allow for the agent to be trained on a 
continuous action space.

### <a name="rnn">RNN Text Generation</a>
This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate text.

### <a name="stable">Stable Diffusion</a>
This project uses the Stable Diffusion model to generate images. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The 
model is then used to generate images that are similar to the images in the dataset.

### <a name="style">Style Transfer</a>
This project uses a convolutional neural network to transfer the style of one image to another image.

### <a name="translator">English to Spanish Translator</a>
This project uses a Transformer model to translate English to Spanish. The model is trained on a dataset of English 
and Spanish General Conference taks.
